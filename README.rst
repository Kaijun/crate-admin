=====================
Crate Admin Interface
=====================

A slick admin interface for `Crate`_.

``"Crate is a new breed of database to serve todayâ€™s mammoth data needs."``

.. note::

  The admin interface is bundled with every Crate distribution.
  There is no need to install it separately, except if you want to
  contribute to the project.

  The admin interface is accessible on port ``4200`` when Crate is running.
  For example::

    http://crate1.example.com:4200/admin/


Set up from source
==================

This project uses buildout to set up all requirements.
As of now, you only need `Bower`_.

Install ``npm`` and ``bower`` using the buildout commands::

    python bootstrap.py

    bin/buildout -N

To bootstrap the app simply run ``npm`` and ``bower`` in this crate-admin folder::

    bin/npm install

    bin/bower install

Create distribution::

    bin/grunt build

To run the Admin UI standalone simply open the ``index.html``
in the ``dist`` folder in your browser. To connect to a running Crate
instance that is not running on ``localhost:4200`` you can append
a ``base_uri`` parameter to the URL::

    file:///.../dist/index.html?base_uri=http://host.example.com:4200

However this is recommended only for development purposes!
